# CartPole Agent

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent to solve the CartPole problem using [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com). The goal is to balance a pole ona cart moving along a track.

## Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **OpenAI Gym**: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.
* **TensorFlow/Keras**: For implementing the neural network.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations
